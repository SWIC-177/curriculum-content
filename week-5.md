# Week 5️⃣

## Homework Review

The homework was a combination of an overall review to help solidify our web development tools concepts and an introduction to one of the most popular, if not the most popular way to write CSS in modern applications, Tailwind CSS.

Summarily, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. It is a low-level framework that provides you with a set of utility classes that you can use to build your designs. It is a great tool for rapid prototyping and building custom designs.

## Homework Due for Thursday (10 points)

### _Eloquent JavaScript_ Introduction

Read and reflect on the [Introduction from _Eloquent JavaScript_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#h_GlF1Kuv0JF). Read **through** the section entitled [_What is JavaScript?_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#h_UmlI5uNVqn). This [video](https://somup.com/cZn62bpoxH) marks where to start and stop reading.

### Mozilla MDN JavaScript Guide

Read and reflect on the following:

1. [What Is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#what_is_javascript)
1. [JavaScript and Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#javascript_and_java)
1. [JavaScript and the ECMAScript Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#javascript_and_the_ecmascript_specification)

There are a lot of links within those ☝️ links, but don't worry about clicking on them. Just read through the content and reflect on it.

---

'Read and reflect' means the same as it has. You may take notes, write a summary, or simply reflect on the reading. The goal is to engage with the material in a way that helps you to understand it better.

You'll create a Gist with a `.md` extension and share the link in BrightSpace. Alternatively, you can update some previous 'Reflections document' and share the link in BrightSpace. Make sure that it's not marked as private so that I can see it. Upload any document to satisfy BrightSpace's requirements, but I will be looking at the Gist or the Reflections document as a link that I can immediately click on and grade.

The quality of your MD counts. Use headings, paragraphs and/or lists, etc. Here's a cheat sheet from [Brad Traversy](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bradtraversy/547a7bbf35ffba1561706e161a50b05a/raw/aed91bd0c570b240761bab7e67510a0817daaa8c/sample.md), who makes decent videos, BTW.

Don't just send a wall of text like you're sending a Snap message or something!

## Homework Due for Saturday (20 points)

Follow along with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/_y_3c4wRVOc?si=jPTXjCY9CFbwn_y3). Here is [a starter Playground link that should give you the HTML that I am using](https://play.tailwindcss.com/0QqzGV4Xlu) in the video.

⚠️ The video goes quite fast as it was meant to be just a high-level intro and not really a 'tutorial' per se, so **don't worry about getting it all.** Again, this is based upon your efforts, and feel free to remix it a bit and add your own creativity. Just make it look 'good enough' while taking some pride in your work.

## GitHub Copilot in the CLI! (Not HW)

If you've already [enabled Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart#signing-up-for-github-copilot-for-your-personal-account), you can [install and activate it in your CLI!](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli/using-github-copilot-in-the-cli#installing-copilot-in-the-cli)

As a reminder, CLI means the same as the terminal or command prompt. For Windows, that's GitBash. For Mac, that's Warp or iTerm2. Anyway, here's a [video](https://somup.com/cZn62Epoy0).
