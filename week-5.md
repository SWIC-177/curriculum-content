# Week 5Ô∏è‚É£

## Homework Review

The homework was a combination of an overall review to help solidify our web development tools concepts and an introduction to one of the most popular, if not the most popular way to write CSS in modern applications, Tailwind CSS.

Summarily, Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. It is a low-level framework that provides you with a set of utility classes that you can use to build your designs. It is a great tool for rapid prototyping and building custom designs.

## Homework Due for Tuesday (10 points)

As indicated in the video, submit the completed link from the Tailwind Playground via BrightSpace.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript was first created by Brendan Eich in the mid-90s while he worked for a browser company called Netscape. There are a few different origin stories, but supposedly it was called LiveScript originally. However, because of a marketing decision, in an attempt to ride the coattails of Java it was renamed to JavaScript.

There is no direct association between Java and JavaScript - they are wholly separate. Brendan was asked to take into account the popularity of the 'hot new' Java language, so there are a few ideas from this language brought in, but, generally speaking, Java is to JavaScript as Ham is to Hammock.

JS, like most approachable programming languages, is 'higher order.' It is composed of words and characters that are understood by humans. Upon execution üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, these understandable words and phrases are interpreted and translated into 'lower order' languages (less human-friendly) and eventually become 'machine language.'

The JS interpreter is written in C++, which in turn gets compiled into C and Assembly until it is really no longer 'human readable' - just data streams of 1s and 0s - machine language.

## The JS 'Sales Pitch'

JavaScript(JS) is the most applicable, powerful and flexible language in the world today - no other language in the world allows us to work natively in the browser (client side) while also on the server (NodeJS) while also creating super-fast web-based applications (Single Page Applications - SPAs- Angular or React or Vue) while also using the same code to create native desktop applications (Electron) while also creating native mobile apps (React Native or NativeScript)!

Furthermore, very few programming languages allow as much flexibility (double-edged sword - means there is more to learn) in terms of how we write our code, vis-√†-vis approaches, organization, architecture, etc. In other words, JS is a multi-paradigm language.

No other programming language is 'built in' to every single web browser by default. That is the main reason why JS rules web development. This course focuses on using JS in the browser (after we learn a few programming fundamentals).

## EcmaScript vs JavaScript

EcmaScript represents a 'governing body' of sorts that oversees scripting languages...at this point that pretty much just means the same as JavaScript, although, there are technically a few other scripting languages out there that are 'managed' by the EcmaScript committee. Specifically, a group of about 50-100 good folks sit on the TC39 committee.

For all intents and purposes, EcmaScript and JavaScript are used interchangeably. Technically, the term 'JavaScript' is trademarked by Oracle.

We won't bog ourselves down with too many such trivialities, but it's worth noting that JavaScript as a language got a major overhaul in June of 2015. This came to be known as ES2015 AKA ES6. Since that time, there have been regular annual updates to the language's specification, and these have been adopted by all of the major browsers fairly quickly. These recent updates have been known as: ES2016/ES7, ES2017/ES8 and then ES2019/ES9.

Suffice to say, we will primarily focus on writing our JavaScript using the newest features of the language, or in other words, our code will use ES2015+ syntax (a fancy word meaning the keywords and 'grammar'/structure of the way that we write our code).

## Homework Due for Thursday (10 points)

### _Eloquent JavaScript_ Introduction

Read and reflect on the [Introduction from _Eloquent JavaScript_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#h_GlF1Kuv0JF). Read **through** the section entitled [_What is JavaScript?_](https://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html#h_UmlI5uNVqn). This [video](https://somup.com/cZn62bpoxH) marks where to start and stop reading.

~~### Mozilla MDN JavaScript Guide~~

~~Read and reflect on the following:~~

~~1. [What Is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#what_is_javascript)~~
~~1. [JavaScript and Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#javascript_and_java)~~
~~1. [JavaScript and the ECMAScript Specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#javascript_and_the_ecmascript_specification)~~

~~There are a lot of links within those ‚òùÔ∏è links, but don't worry about clicking on them. Just read through the content and reflect on it.~~

'Read and reflect' means the same as it has. You may take notes, write a summary, or simply reflect on the reading. The goal is to engage with the material in a way that helps you to understand it better.

You'll create a Gist with a `.md` extension and share the link in BrightSpace. Alternatively, you can update some previous 'Reflections document' and share the link in BrightSpace. Make sure that it's not marked as private so that I can see it. Upload any document to satisfy BrightSpace's requirements, but I will be looking at the Gist or the Reflections document as a link that I can immediately click on and grade.

The quality of your MD counts. Use headings, paragraphs and/or lists, etc. Here's a cheat sheet from [Brad Traversy](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/bradtraversy/547a7bbf35ffba1561706e161a50b05a/raw/aed91bd0c570b240761bab7e67510a0817daaa8c/sample.md), who makes decent videos, BTW.

Don't just send a wall of text like you're sending a Snap message or something!

## Homework Due for Saturday (20 points)

Follow along with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/_y_3c4wRVOc?si=jPTXjCY9CFbwn_y3). Here is [a starter Playground link that should give you the HTML that I am using](https://play.tailwindcss.com/0QqzGV4Xlu) in the video.

‚ö†Ô∏è The video goes quite fast as it was meant to be just a high-level intro and not really a 'tutorial' per se, so **don't worry about getting it all.** Again, this is based upon your efforts, and feel free to remix it a bit and add your own creativity. Just make it look 'good enough' while taking some pride in your work.

Once you have finished, share your Tailwind Playground link via BrightSpace. Again, you will need to upload any filler file, but then just paste the link directly in the message.

## GitHub Copilot in the CLI! (Not HW)

If you've already [enabled Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart#signing-up-for-github-copilot-for-your-personal-account), you can [install and activate it in your CLI!](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/github-copilot-in-the-cli/using-github-copilot-in-the-cli#installing-copilot-in-the-cli)

As a reminder, CLI means the same as the terminal or command prompt. For Windows, that's GitBash. For Mac, that's Warp or iTerm2. Anyway, here's a [video](https://somup.com/cZn62Epoy0).
