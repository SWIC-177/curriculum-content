# Week 6Ô∏è‚É£

## Homework Review

The below üëáüèæ 3Ô∏è‚É£ videos are essentially my reflections on what you read.

Despite the impression that I may give in the third video, generally speaking MDN is a great resource overall. Beyond just using the AI ü§ñ, for a deeper understanding definitely rely on MDN above random blog posts.

## Homework Due for Tuesday (10 points)

Write up 2Ô∏è‚É£ 'reflections' documents (in well-written `.md` files, of course). The first 1Ô∏è‚É£ will be kind of short, but it would concern my reflections in the _Homework Review_ section ‚òùÔ∏è.

In this first document, you can gloss over my mention of JS being not just OOP but a multi-paradigm programming language. I will need to do a separate video on that part! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

In the second one, I want you to write with just a bit more detail a general list of the steps that I went through in creating the NodeJS Template Repo. What were some of the files that I created? For what? What was the purpose? What is the actual ü§¨ meaning?

Again, this doesn't need to be too detailed. It should demonstrate that you know the roles of the various files in the repo. Here's the finished [repo](https://github.com/SWIC-177/node-template/tree/main) for reference.

## Let's Look at some JS Code

### Additional Note

The code shown in the video included code comments. These are denoted by: `//`. Any lines that start with `//` are comments and are not executed by the JavaScript engine. They are just for human readers.

## Homework Due for Thursday (10 points)

This will be another 'notes/reflections' document üìù. üÜî all of the keywords and concepts that I go over in the sample code shown. This one should be quite detailed. Make sure to mention the naming conventions for the variables and functions.

Include your reflections. This is our first time looking at some actual code. What did you think? Was it easy to follow? Did you understand the concepts? What was the most difficult part? What was the easiest part?

## Homework Due for Saturday (20 points)

[Classroom Repo for IN1](https://classroom.github.com/a/o08H9aZ6)
[Classroom Repo for IN2](https://classroom.github.com/a/CIlfLl8-)

In the `index.js`:

1. Create a function called `greet`. It should take a single parameter called `name`. It should return a string that says "Hello, " and then the `name` that was passed in.
1. Call the function, passing in your name as a **string argument.** Assign the **return value** to a variable `greeting`.
1. Log that variable to the console.

Run your code in the terminal (`node index.js`). If done correctly, you should see "Hello, " and then your name.

**Add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub.** You should have at least 3Ô∏è‚É£ commits. One for each of the steps above.

## Extra Credit (5 points)

It's highly recommended that you complete this extra work. These are things we will be doing later on anyway, so this is a good opportunity to get a head start.

1. Research [**template literals**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals). Rewrite the `greet` function to use a **template literal.** This should be done in a separate commit.
1. Research [**ES6 arrow functions**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). Rewrite the `greet` function to use an **arrow function.** This should be done in a separate commit.
1. Replace or update the contents of the `README.md` with your thoughts and reflections on this week's work. Focus on the use of these more modern approaches (**template literals** and **arrow functions**). This should be done in a separate commit.
