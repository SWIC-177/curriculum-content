### Mac/Linux

I don't explicitly show Linux, but the presumption is that if you are on Linux, you know what you're doing. It's not that different from Mac in terms of the terminal.

1. [Homebrew and Warp Terminal](https://somup.com/cZVIrykzj0)
1. [Warp and VS Code](https://somup.com/cZVIrmkzjK)

There is one other command that I want you to run in your terminal: `brew install git`. This will install git on your machine.

## Make Git Use VS Code by Default

This is for everyone!

Exit out of your terminal (Git Bash or Warp) and restart it. Then type `cd` and press 'enter' to make sure that you are in your home directory.

Finally: `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`.

### Create an Introductory Video

Shoot for 1-3 minutes. Introduce yourself and tell me a little bit about yourself. What do you do for a living? What are your hobbies? What are you hoping to get out of this course? What are you hoping to do with JavaScript?
