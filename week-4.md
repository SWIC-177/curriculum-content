# Week 4️⃣

## Homework Review

You were to learn about _How Computers Work._ Whenever we do these types of assignments, I'm expecting well-formatted MD and some type of personal comments, feedbacks or perspectives. It's important to develop this habit or trying to relate facts and figures to things in your life or things that you know. This is a skill that will help you in your career and help you make an impression during interviews. Just repeating facts and figures is not enough. You need to show that you understand them and can relate them to your own experiences. Hence, we call them 'reflections 🪞.

Basically, if you did anything like that at all, you got full credit. If you didn't followed procedures from previous weeks and **share** a Gist link instead of Zips, screenshots or embeds, I docked a couple of points.

Yes, I realize that BrightSpace requires an actual file to submit as well. 🤷🏾‍♀️

All of the above applies especially to your 'pre-recorded interview questions.
